To set the bot up, you will need:
A executor
A Computer
The ROBLOX Client
and the script on my github
1) open your executor
2) open any game
3) get the script from my github (https://github.com/cOpEtriNe/RBLXFactBot/blob/main/RBLXFACTBOT.lua)
4) inject your executor into the ROBLOX client 
5) copy the contents from my script ALL OF THE SCRIPT, execute the script
Aaaaand done! you have used my script, if there is any bugs, contact me at my github or cOpEtriNe#4559 on discord
you can also use a afk script to leave it running, to not get kicked from the server.
