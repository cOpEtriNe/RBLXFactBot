This is a bot i made that says random facts, they are useless facts from a site (https://bestlifeonline.com/useless-facts/) 
it's not so random, because the facts are in a order set by me, you can mix these up if you wish.
i'll update this most of the time, i'm planning to add a GUI to this for better customization. Like How Fast the bot talks, or to stop the bot.
While writing this i might add a not so secret admin command to activate it or de-activate it you can edit this is if you wan't.
The Website Is avalible at:https://rblxfactbot.github.io/
If the website is down, i will look into it.

Enjoy.
